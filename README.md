# Stereo

An API for rapid protoptying of real-time audio programs.

Functions as an easy entry point to audio I/O on osx (maybe linux?), built on top of RtAudio

Inspired from the setup/loop/cleaup style of APIs from Bela, Processing, Arduino, 

Ideally, this as a tool to rapidly generate and test audio DSP algorithms, cool effects, synthesizers, (maybe openGL visualizers w SDL), and port them to many other

The goal of this repo is to make low-latency audio programming extremely accessible with as little boilerplate as possible.
